# Control-system-for-Sorting-boxes-in-a-Production-line
control system for sorting boxes of sizes 30 20 10 in a production line, i used ultrasonic distance sensor i placed it on top to detect the distance from the the top of the boxes to the sensor, if the box is big the distance should be small, if the box is medium the distance should be bigger than before, if the box is small the distance should be the biggest.
there are three angles in which the boxes are dropped
